# Interview Algorithms & Data Structures 🐍

A personal library of common computer science algorithms implemented in Python. 

## 🎯 Purpose
To demonstrate understanding of core CS concepts including:
- **Search Algorithms:** Binary Search (Iterative), DFS (Recursive).
- **Sorting:** Merge Sort (Divide & Conquer strategy).
- **Time Complexity:** Focus on O(log n) and O(n log n) efficiency.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Focus:** Clean code, modular design, and Big-O optimization.

## 🚀 How to Run
You can copy any file content into a Python environment or online compiler (like Programiz or Replit) to see the output.
